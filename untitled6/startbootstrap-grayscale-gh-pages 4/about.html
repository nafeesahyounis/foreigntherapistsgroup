          <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
          <h4 style="padding-top:10px;"><p>As a group of international psychotherapists who are based in the Czech Republic our
mission is to reach out and connect with the global community. A community which we
believe has not only many colourful cultures, histories and languages, but many
individual needs, many unique stories that need a space to be expressed.</p></h4>
    <h4 style="padding-top:10px;"> <p> We aim to offer just that, a space where you can find a psychotherapist who can speak
freely in your language, and is either a native from the UK, USA, Germany and The
Czech Republic, or who has spent time living outside their own native country. We
understand that moving abroad and starting over in a new or old country can be a big
adventure, but can also bring many unknowns. As a result we believe that the value of
having a psychotherapist with whom we can share a common cultural framework has
the possibility to make a difference in psychotherapy. </p> </h4>

to become psychotherapists. Each follow the ethical guidelines of their respective
associations and comply with Continuing Professional Development (CPD), whereby
they engage in learning activities in order to develop and enhance their professional
abilities.</p>

overwhelming feelings. We are however not a Crisis Intervention team. We do not deal
with immediate crises, there are plenty of expert crisis lines you can contact for this.</p></h4>
